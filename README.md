This is a minimal Ubuntu setup for Vagrant to run weewx
in simulator mode using the current version available
in mwall's apt-get repository.

To connect to the vm for weewx data, simply open a browser
on your host to http://localhost:8080/weewx after waiting
the typical 5 minutes for the initial files to be created.

See the Vagrantfile and provision.sh script for more details.
